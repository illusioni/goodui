		<h1>An experiment with a hopefully good solution for rich web user interfaces</h1>


		<h2>Why this experiment?</h2>

		<p>Basically because Adobe Flex is dead.
				Declarative UI code, clear separation of concerns, skinnable components, ... You could write maintainable UI code on all platforms for all platforms with little effort!</p>

		<p>And suddenly - Flash banned from iOS - it was clear that it had little chances to play a significant role in the future. What now? There seemed to be no alternative of similar quality.<br>
		What I had seen of Javascript wasn't inviting at all - global scope, no early type checking, lots of boilerplate code, poor testing support, pretty much everything I didn't want.</p>
				
		<p>Now - just recently - a colleague showed us a piece of software developed with a set of JS libraries that actually looked... good!</p>


		<h2>What is 'good' UI code to me?</h2>

		<p>Concise, readable, testable, maintainable, robust - that's for a start.</p>


		<h2>What's involved?</h2>	

		<p>Don't know what I'll end up with. I'll start assuming this list of utilities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Backbone.js</li>
			<li>Handlebars.js</li>
			<li>Underscore.js</li>
			<li>Curl.js</li>
			<li>Bootstrap</li>
			<li>CSS 3</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Procedure</h2>

		<p>I'll start with nothing and ask a question. Then I will research the answer and ask the next question. Everytime a question is answered, I'll commit the codebase and the documentation to a git repository and start over with the next question.</p>

		<p>There'll never be more than one question except the original question raises another one that has to be answered as a step towards the original question's solution. So basically we're facing a stack here.</p>

		<p>Ready? I am. Let's start <a href="doc/stack.txt">the stack</a>!</p>
