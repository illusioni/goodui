<h1>Technical documentation</h1>

<p>This page explains, why/how this application does some things the way it does them.</p>


<h2>Server-side stuff</h2>


<h3>MVC routing</h3>

<p>All http requests starting with /goodui/mvc/* - like for example the one for the <a href="/goodui/mvc/hello">hello</a> page
or the <a href="/goodui/mvc/events/42">event</a> resource pages
are handled by a <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">Spring MVC</a>
dispatcher servlet. This servlet is made known to the web container in file web.xml.
Spring loads and injects a context (references to instantiated beans) into this servlet.</p>

<p>If not specified otherwise (here it isn't) the dispatcher servlet's context configuration is resolved by convention:
The Spring container (a listener also configured in web.xml) looks for a file in WEB-INF with the dispatcher servlet's name
and the suffix '-servlet.xml'</p>

<p>The dispatcher servlet scans the packages configured in its context for classes with the annotations @Controller and @RequestMapping.
It then uses the string values of the request mapping annotations to determine which requests to route to the controller.</p>

<p>(In this application...)<br>
A controller fills a model with values and returns the name of a view.
The view is a JSP page that can access the model's values to render dynamic information into its output.</p>
