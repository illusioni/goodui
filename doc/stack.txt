== Question(s):

How do I work with the URL?

What's the History API?

== Details:

Focus: Use parts of the URL to determine what data to request from the backend
Not my focus right now: History support

History API: http://backbonejs.org/#Router
http://html5demos.com/history
http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
